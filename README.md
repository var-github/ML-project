## The project compares different model on the data and concludes tree based models are the best

The project compares
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- K-nearest Neighbours Regression
- Descision Tree Regression
- Bagging Regression
- Extra Tree Regression
- Bayesian Ridge Regression
- Ridge Regression


All data used to train the model were collected from [http://data.icrisat.org/dld/](http://data.icrisat.org/dld/)
