### The project aims to compares different model on the data and conclude which model best fits the data

The project uses these models in the comparison
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Boosting Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- K-nearest Neighbours Regression
- Descision Tree Regression
- Bagging Regression
- Extra Tree Regression
- Bayesian Ridge Regression
- Ridge Regression

> Conclusion: Tree bases models were the best, particularly Random Forest Regression

All data used to train the model were collected from [http://data.icrisat.org/dld/](http://data.icrisat.org/dld/)
